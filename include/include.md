# Computer Organization: RISC-V CPU

## Basic Components

A RISC-V CPU system consists of the following core parts:

1. **CPU / Core:**  The processing unit of the system responsible for executing instructions.
2. **DRAM:** Dynamic Random Access Memory, the main memory for storing instructions and data.
3. **BUS:** The communication channel connecting the CPU, DRAM, and peripheral devices.

## CPU Internals

Inside the CPU, we find critical components:

*   **Registers:**  Fast, temporary storage areas within the CPU used for processing data.
*   **Program Counter (PC):**  A special register that stores the address of the current instruction being executed by the CPU.
*   **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):**  The circuitry responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations.
